### Deploy an application using AWS EC2, nginx, secure it using SSL/TLS in ACM, and Route 53 for DNS resolution.

**Project Objective :** _This project demonstrates a real-world approach to securely deploying a web application on AWS EC2._
_The application is exposed through Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer, mapped to a custom domain using GoDaddy, and secured with Route 53 for HTTPS, DNS protection, and traffic filtering. The setup focuses on security, scalability, and production-grade access patterns commonly used in real deployments._

**Tools used:**
* **Route 53** for DNS resolution
* **GoDaddy** for domain name (paid)
* **ACM for SSL/TLS** certificate management
* **Nginx** as Reverse Proxy
* **AWS EC2** instance
